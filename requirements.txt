- `middleware.py`: Contains custom middleware components for processing requests and responses globally. You can create custom middleware classes that reside in this file.

- `apps.py`: Configuration for individual applications within your project. This can include app-specific settings, such as `django.apps` configurations.

- `migrations/`: Directory storing database migration files generated when changes are made to your models. Common packages include `django.db.migrations`.

- `templates/`: If you're using Django templates to generate dynamic HTML, this directory can store your HTML templates. You can use the `django.template` package.

- `static/`: Organize static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images, which are served to clients. You can use Django's `django.contrib.staticfiles` package for this purpose.
